Given that I have used a password manager for many years (thus each password being unique), yet being in many data breaches.... let's SHA1 hash all my passwords and compare it to the haveibeenpwned database to find out who has been irresponsible with my accounts.

tl;dr: Whilst the tool works, none of my unique passwords were leaked by anyone identifiable.

# Approach
The HIBP database is a flat file format of sorted hashes, prepended with a count of how many time the password has been "seen". 

The filesize is around 40GB, so not quick to search through by grep alone. 

This tool performs a binary search for all the hashes and returns a response within milliseconds.

# file formats

## bitwarden file format
Full format has been omitted for brevity.
```json
{
  "encrypted": false,
  "items": [
    {
      "name": "example.com",
      "login": {
        "username": null,
        "password": "password1234"
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "example2.com",
      "login": {
        "username": null,
        "password": "password"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## bitwarden -> whopwnedme (wpm) format
I don't want to have my passwords laying around in plain text. So I'll convert them all to SHA1, and this program will work with the below format:
```json
{
    "passwords": [
        {
            "name": "example.com",
            "username": "adrian",
            "sha1": "64A6DA114D17AE8F167F6BE2C4AEBC9E99F7466C"
        }
    ]
}
```

## answering the question
Q: How do I know which website leaked my password `666mySuperUniquePassword@!"Â£$%^&*()_`?

A: By comparing the locally generated SHA1 hash of my source password, and comparing it to haveibeenpwned: it was `example.com` - It's unique, and only `example.com` knew it.


# How to run
Check the [Makefile](./Makefile) for the commands to build, run, test, etc.

```sh
Usage: who-pwned-me [command] [args]

        Commands:
                convert  Converts a plain text password file to hashed SHA1 versions for who-pwned me to use (written to stdout)
                        -provider
                                        The provider of the password export (REQUIRED), supported providers: [bitwarden]
                        -path
                                        Path to the exported password file you wish to convert (REQUIRED)

                compare  Compare the HIBP database against your own WPM password file (matches written to stdout)
                        -hibp-path
                                        Path to the haveibeenpwned password file, containing SHA1 hashes (REQUIRED)
                        -wpm-path
                                        Path to the who-pwned-me password file, containing your SHA1 hashed passwords (REQUIRED)

        Examples:
                who-pwned-me convert -provider bitwarden -path bitwarden.json # convert the provided bitwarden json file to a who-pwned-me file
                who-pwned-me compare -hibp-path hibp.txt -wpm-path wpm.json # compare the who-pwned-me file with the haveibeenpwned database file
```
